## Description

To find best position I was using greedy algorithm. 
1. I've found all of my disks (X) on the board, because I can only put a disk diagonnaly or oppostite to it;
2. From each disk I move to all possible (Up, Down, Up and Left ...) directions and count potential scores;
3. Also I remeber visited points. If I have been there already, I skip it poisiton;
